The player has to select the tiles in order to make the given number.<br/>
For example, as shown above, if the number is 12, the player can select the tiles 6, *, and 2 because 6\*2 = 12.<br/>
The player can also click on the brown tiles in order to put them in their inventory for future use.<br/>
All games are multiplayer, so other players can join, and if another player picks a tile, that tile becomes un-pickable by other players.

<h1>Describe Game :</h1>
